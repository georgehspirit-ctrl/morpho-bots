# morpho-bots

Off-chain Morpho bots — reallocators, liquidation monitors, market makers, and similar — and the
shared packages they consume. Every bot is a long-running program that holds a key, signs
transactions, and moves funds on mainnets with no human approving each action, so the code favors
safe and explainable over clever or fast.

This is a [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) monorepo:

- `bots/` — individual bot apps (one per bot); each keeps its own `README.md`
- `packages/` — shared libraries the bots depend on

Pull requests are not accepted at this time; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Issues are

| [@repo/contracts](./packages/contracts/)                 | Shared contract ABIs and Executor sources                                    |

| [@repo/monitoring](./packages/monitoring/)               | Monitor interval waits, serial operation queue, cycle-failure predicate      |
| [@repo/observability](./packages/observability/)         | Bot lifecycle/record shipping, process observers, verbose argv gating        |

## Getting started

```sh
nvm use               # Node 24.14.1 (see .nvmrc)
corepack enable pnpm  # pnpm 11.1.1, pinned by package.json#packageManager
pnpm install
pnpm build            # @repo/contracts ABIs, needed by the liquidation bots' tests
```

`pnpm` denies dependency lifecycle scripts by default — see `allowBuilds` in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`. An install that needs a new one fails loudly rather than running it.

## Daily commands

```sh
pnpm run lint          # oxlint, repo-wide
pnpm format            # oxfmt, repo-wide
pnpm -r run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit in every workspace package
pnpm run knip          # dead-code detection
pnpm test              # vitest projects plus Node playground suites
```

The fork and e2e suites under `bots/*/test/fork/` and `bots/quoter-bot/test/e2e/` fork Base at a
pinned block and need `RPC_URL_8453` set to an archive endpoint; see each bot's README.

## Releases

Release tags look like `<bot>-<PR#>`, for example `quoter-bot-227`. A `quoter-bot-*` tag publishes
the npm package and the Docker Hub image.

/**
 * Walks every page of a cursor-paginated endpoint and returns the concatenated rows.
 *
 * Following the cursor is not optional. Stopping after the first page silently truncates the result
 * to whatever the server's page size happens to be — a number the client does not control and that
 * these APIs do not document, so no single response can be assumed complete. The under-inclusion
 * that follows surfaces as neither an error nor an empty result, which is what makes it dangerous.
 *
 * `maxPages` is a runaway-cursor backstop, NOT an expected limit: an endpoint that never returns a
 * null cursor would otherwise loop forever. Reaching it sets `truncated`, which callers are expected
 * to report — this function deliberately does no logging so it can live below the logger in the
 * dependency graph, and because the event name and fields belong to the caller either way.
 *
 * `truncated` covers only that backstop, so it is not a general "the walk was incomplete" flag: a
 * rejecting `fetchPage` rejects this call and discards the rows already collected, rather than
 * returning them with `truncated` set. Retries and per-request deadlines therefore belong inside
 * `fetchPage`, which is also the only place any I/O happens — this function is otherwise pure.
 *
 * @param fetchPage Called once per page, in order, with the previous page's cursor (`null` first).
 * @param options.maxPages Hard cap on pages fetched. Must be at least 1; one page is always fetched.
 * @returns Every row in page order, the page count, and whether the cap stopped the walk early.
 * @throws Whatever `fetchPage` rejects with, unwrapped and with collected rows discarded.

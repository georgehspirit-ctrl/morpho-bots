/**
 * Per-position exponential backoff, keyed by the `${id}:${borrower}` label. The primary API
 * rate-limit defense: a position that repeatedly fails to quote or simulate (illiquid pair, no route,
 * a persistent bad-debt edge case) stops being re-quoted/re-simulated every block, so API and RPC
 * usage stay bounded even under a backlog. In-memory only — like the pending queue, chain truth wins
 * on restart, so there is nothing to persist.

/**
 * One-shot, idempotent deployment of the generic Executor singleton to its deterministic CREATE2
 * address via the canonical Foundry/Arachnid deterministic-deployment-proxy. Reuses `Executor.with()`
 * so the deployed address provably matches the bot's derived address and the deployless lens (one
 * salt, one source of truth). The Executor has no constructor, so the bytecode — and therefore the
 * address — is identical on every chain (given the pinned solc + optimizer settings).
 *
 * Run once per chain:
 *
 *   RPC_URL=… DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=… pnpm --filter @repo/contracts run deploy:executor
 *
 * Idempotent: a no-op (exit 0) if the deterministic address already holds code.

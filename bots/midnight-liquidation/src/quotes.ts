/**
 * The Midnight-shaped adapter over `@repo/swaps`' {@link composeMultiVenueQuoting}: keeps the
 * `(plan, out)` signature the tick consumes and projects the lens output into the package's plain
 * `QuoteRequest`. The package resolves the pre-swap unwrap chain, then starts — without awaiting —
 * the venue probe for the POST-unwrap `(collateral, loan)` pair, gated to this liquidatable pair and
 * staleMs-cached so no venue calls hit quiet markets. Venues are ranked against whatever the cache
 * already holds, and only the chosen one is firm-quoted. A missing collateral slot or an operator-excluded collateral short-circuits
 * to `no_config` (no API call), preserving no-API-call semantics for a position the bot won't route.
 *
 * `resolveRoute` exposes just the pair half of that pipeline, for the tick's phase A.5, so the expensive
 * half is not duplicated: the probe refresh the composer then starts for the same pair is absorbed by
 * the selector's staleness and in-flight gates, phase A.5 having already started it — which means the
 * cache may still be cold when the quote reads it, and fails open accordingly. It walks
 * {@link previewUnwrapChain} rather than resolving, so an exotic collateral costs NO amount-dependent
 * work here — a PT's pair comes off the TTL-cached markets list and a vault share's off the memoized
 * `asset()`, where resolving would have spent a hosted Pendle request whose calldata is then discarded
 * and re-fetched at quote time. Falls back to a full resolve only if some unwrapper lacks the seam.

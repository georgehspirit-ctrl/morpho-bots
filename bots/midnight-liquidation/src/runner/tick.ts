/**
 * Per-tick outcome tally, emitted as `tick.end`, ordered as the pipeline runs. On a tick that ran to
 * completion (`complete: true`) these identities hold, so a stage added without a counter breaks a
 * sum instead of silently dropping a position:
 *
 * ```text
 * pairs        >= liquidatable
 * liquidatable === inflightSkipped + planSkipped + planned          (per POSITION)
 * candidates   === cooledDown + backoffSkipped + siblingSkipped + preselectSkipped
 *                  + noSwapPath + quoteFailed + quoteUnprofitable + ok + reverted   (per CANDIDATE)
 * ok           === submitted + notSent
 * notSent      === sendRefused + sendReverted + sendRejected
 * ```
 *
 * **The two middle identities count different things**, because one position can yield several
 * candidates — one per activated collateral slot and mode. Everything up to sizing is per position;
 * everything phase B works is per candidate, since that is what a quote and a simulation are spent on.
 * `candidates >= planned`, with equality only when every position had exactly one activated slot in
 * exactly one open mode (a matured-and-unhealthy slot is sized in both).
 *
 * A new loop **exit** must join one of these sums; a new **attribute** of a position that is still
 * worked must not (it would double-count). Any future pre-quote skip therefore belongs in the
 * `candidates` sum, and any future plan-stage skip rides `planSkipped`. `unpriced` is an attribute: an
 * unpriced candidate is still worked, just ordered last, so it deliberately joins no sum.
 *
 * On `complete: false` the `ok` identity is short by one: an aborting `submit` throws after `ok` was
 * counted. The `notSent` decomposition still holds, since that throw increments none of its four terms.

 * at the venues' ~1 rps is seconds of wall clock — spent inside the maturity burst this ordering exists
 * to win, and before any quote runs. So it warms for the NEXT tick and this tick reads whatever the
 * cache already holds: a first tick falls open to gross ordering and the curve converges within a tick
 * or two. `VenueSelector.refresh` dedupes an in-flight sweep, so neither the next tick nor the quoting
 * layer's own refresh can double-probe a pair being warmed.
 *

 * several slots on one pair — or several positions in one market — trigger one sweep; and no pair
 * without a sized candidate is ever probed. A candidate that needs no route at all (a swap-free slot, a
 * bad-debt write-off) — or one phase B will suppress anyway — resolves nothing and warms nothing.

/**
 * One tick: enumerate the over-inclusive (id, borrower) candidate universe from discovery, read the
 * liquidation lens fresh for the whole batch (one deployless `eth_call`), and for each liquidatable
 * position build a plan, resolve its swap step, simulate the real `exec_606BaXt`, and — when the
 * simulation is `ok` and the position is not already in flight — broadcast it via `submit`.
 * Pending-queue upkeep (`queue.onBlock`) is NOT driven here: the runner runs it as an independent
 * per-block maintenance phase so it survives a discovery/lens failure in this tick. Deps are injected
 * so the tick is unit-testable without a chain, a discovery endpoint, or a signer.
 *
 * Discovery failure is tolerated: a transient error is logged (`discover.error`) and the tick proceeds
 * with zero new candidates. The lens reads every candidate fresh on-chain, so discovery is a coverage
 * source, never a correctness dependency.
 *
 * Between sizing and that expensive work sits phase A.5 ({@link prepareRoutes}), which resolves the
 * pairs the sized candidates actually sell through and starts (never awaits) warming their probe
 * curves, so the ordering can charge each candidate its route cost instead of ranking on the oracle
 * alone. A tick whose curve is not yet warm falls open to gross ordering rather than waiting for it.
 *
 * `tick.end` is emitted even when a position aborts the tick — with `complete: false`, so partial
 * counters can never be mistaken for a genuinely idle tick. See {@link TickCounters} for the
 * counter identities; it also carries `firmCalls` / `firmCallsUnknown` and `durationMs`, which are the
 * two figures a maturity's retry period is actually set by.

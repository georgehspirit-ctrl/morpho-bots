/**
 * Whether a quoted route covers the repay `liquidate` will pull, evaluated BEFORE simulating.
 *
 * Midnight ends `liquidate` with `safeTransferFrom(loanToken, payer, this, repaidUnits)`, re-deriving
 * `repaidUnits` on-chain, while the Executor's callback approves only its own live balance. A route
 * returning less than that derived repay therefore reverts as
 * `ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance` — a balance shortfall wearing an allowance error's
 * clothes, which is why the failure reads as an approval bug and is not one. Gating here turns the
 * revert into a reported skip carrying the numbers the revert string omits.
 *
 * Break-even is read off {@link LiquidationPlan.impliedRepaidUnits} rather than recomputed. The
 * matured-and-unhealthy branch opens both on-chain gates and picks a mode by surplus, so the LIF a
 * plan was sized at is not recoverable from `postMaturityMode` or from chain time — recomputing it
 * here would silently apply the post-maturity ramp to a normal-mode plan and overstate the repay by
 * the whole un-ramped incentive.
 *
 * The comparison uses `expectedAmountOut`, not `amountOutMinimum`. The latter embeds the venue's
 * slippage allowance — 1% by default — which dwarfs the post-maturity incentive (a few bps for the
 * first minutes) and would suppress every viable liquidation for most of the ramp, and permanently on
 * high-LLTV tiers whose entire `maxLif` sits under that allowance.
 *
 * Pure — no RPC, no I/O.

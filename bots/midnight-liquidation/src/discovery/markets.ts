 * two endpoints safe in both directions — one endpoint going down or going stale narrows the whitelist
 * to the sources that are still trustworthy instead of either emptying it (halting all liquidations) or
 * letting a stale set keep a since-delisted market in scope.
 *
 * Union semantics are additive, so the whitelist is only ever as wide as the sources the operator
 * configured; it stays fail-closed on a cold start (every source has `updatedAt === null` → nothing is
 * listed). The flip side of additivity: an ACTIVE delisting takes effect only once every configured
 * source has dropped the market — one endpoint delisting it does not remove it while a peer still
 * lists it.
 *
 * `refresh` fans out to every source concurrently and NEVER throws: each source's failure is logged
 * (`markets.refresh_failed`, with its source label) and the others still land, because a partial
 * refresh must not read as a total one. It then emits `markets.whitelist` with the size of the combined
 * whitelist — the per-source `markets.listed` lines cannot be summed or maxed into that number — and
 * warns `markets.source_expired` when SOME sources are stale. The all-stale case is deliberately NOT
 * warned here: the whitelist being empty is a per-tick condition the caller reports every block (see
 * `markets.whitelist_expired` in the bot's `discover`), because a refresh interval longer than
 * `maxAgeMs` would otherwise leave the halt unreported for most of each interval.
 *
 * Throws if `filters` is empty: an empty union lists nothing, which is indistinguishable from a working
 * fail-closed whitelist and would halt every liquidation in silence.
 *
 * `now` is injectable for tests.

# @morpho-org/quoter

Morpho Midnight quoter CLI: validates maker setup, bootstraps target lending positions, maintains
two-sided rate ladders, and provides explicit recovery commands on Ethereum mainnet and Base.

The package ships one self-contained bundle — no dependencies are installed.

## Install

Requires Node.js 24.14.1 or newer.

```sh
npm install -g @morpho-org/quoter
```

## Quickstart

Configuration comes from environment variables, a YAML file, or both. The CLI discovers
`quoter-bot.yaml` (then `quoter-bot.yml`) in the working directory, or takes an explicit file with
`--config <path>`. Start from the
[example configuration](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-bots/blob/main/bots/quoter-bot/quoter-bot.example.yaml).

```sh
# Read-only readiness checks against the configured maker address (no key required).
morpho-quoter --readonly setup-check

# Inspect every intended action without signing or submitting anything.
morpho-quoter --readonly ladder --monitor --verbose

# Run setup checks, position bootstrap, and ladder monitoring together until SIGINT/SIGTERM.
morpho-quoter start --verbose
```

Start with `--readonly` to inspect every intended action before enabling signing.

## Commands

| Command                 | Behavior                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `setup-check`           | Run quoter readiness checks once, or continuously with `--monitor` |
| `bootstrap`             | Run one position-bootstrap cycle, or continuously with `--monitor` |
| `ladder`                | Run one quoter ladder cycle, or continuously with `--monitor`      |
| `start`                 | Monitor setup, bootstrap, and ladder together until shutdown       |
| `invalidate [group-id]` | Invalidate all active maker offer groups, or one explicit group    |

Root options precede the command: `--config <path>`, `--readonly`, `--json` (JSON Lines output for
automation), and the signer options below. Add `--verbose` to writer commands for safe diagnostics
and submitted transaction hashes. The `bootstrap --monitor` and `ladder --monitor` writer variants
(and `start`) clean up owned offers on SIGINT/SIGTERM; `setup-check --monitor` stays read-only.

## Signing

Exactly one signer source is required in write mode:

```sh
# Environment (preferred for unattended operation): MAKER_PRIVATE_KEY or YAML equivalent.
morpho-quoter setup-check

# Encrypted JSON keystore with a hidden interactive password prompt.
morpho-quoter --keystore ./maker.json --interactive setup-check

# Non-exportable AWS KMS key (AWS_KMS_KEY_ID, AWS_REGION, standard AWS credential chain).
morpho-quoter --aws setup-check
```

AWS mode calls KMS directly. Its signer must differ from `MAKER_ADDRESS`, be authorized by that
maker through Midnight, use the canonical Ecrecover ratifier, and hold the configured gas reserve.
Write mode also requires the fee, spend, gas, and calldata limits listed in the full reference.

`--private-key <key>` and `--password <password>` exist for explicit automation but place secrets in
argv, where process listings and shell history may expose them; prefer `MAKER_PRIVATE_KEY` and
`KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`. Never commit real configuration.

## Exit contract

Success exits `0` and writes human-readable output to stdout; with `--json`, one JSON Lines record
per value (bigints as decimal strings). Failures exit non-zero with an explicit sanitized error on
stderr that never includes credentials, URLs, or provider payloads.

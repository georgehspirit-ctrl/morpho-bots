/**
 * Builds the per-market fresh seconds-to-maturity readers required by maturity premiums.
 * @param parameters - Input object: `entries` are one workflow's configured markets, whose
 * optional `maturityPremium` selects the markets that need the observation beside every rate
 * read; `midnight` resolves SDK market data; `client` reads the latest block; and the optional
 * `blockShareMs` caps latest-block sharing below the default when the workflow's monitor cadence
 * is shorter, so consecutive cycles always observe a fresh timestamp.
 * @returns Readers indexed by market, present only for entries configuring a maturity premium.
 * @throws Nothing while building; a returned reader rejects with the stable sanitized
 * `BootstrapAdapterError` `maturity-read` classification when its market or block read fails, so
 * the composed reference-rate service halts on a repository-owned failure instead of an
 * implementation-specific provider error, and never quotes without the configured premium input.
 * @remarks Shared by the bootstrap and ladder production factories so both workflows resolve the
 * identical curve input. Reads are batched across a cycle instead of issuing two requests per
 * market: the market read is cached per market after its first success because the on-chain
 * maturity is immutable (only `timeToMaturity` is consumed from the cached data), and one
 * latest-block read is shared for a bounded monotonic-clock window — at most fifteen seconds,
 * never more than the caller's cadence — so a serial multi-market sweep sees about one block
 * request per cycle, a faster monitor cadence still refreshes the timestamp every cycle, and a
 * wall-clock step (NTP correction, restored VM snapshot) can never extend the share window. The
 * bounded within-sweep staleness is harmless because integer flooring moves a resolved premium
 * roughly one BPS per several days at operational slopes. Each reader still resolves its market
 * and block inputs concurrently through `Promise.all`, decay stays clocked on `block.timestamp`
 * via SDK `Market.timeToMaturity` rather than wall clock, and a failed read is evicted so the
 * next cycle retries instead of caching the failure.

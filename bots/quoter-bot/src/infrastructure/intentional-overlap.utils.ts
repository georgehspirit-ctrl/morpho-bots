 * Detects a crossed maker book while exempting only one exact, durably owned bootstrap-buy /
 * ladder-sell equality per market.
 * @param offers - Complete selected maker book with optional validated ownership roles.
 * @returns `true` for any strict crossing, tie, missing ownership evidence, wrong-side evidence, or
 * multiple best-side offers; `false` for positive spreads and the narrow intentional equality.
 * @remarks This pure check fails closed. Ownership must be attached by each boundary from durable
 * bootstrap and ladder state; market membership alone is never evidence. Cross-book repricing keeps
 * own offers strictly separated except when both strategies saturate the same hard rate bound, so
 * the exempted equality remains reachable only at that bound and for legacy published overlaps.

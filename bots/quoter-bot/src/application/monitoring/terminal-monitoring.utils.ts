/**
 * Projects a terminal failure report into flat records explaining why the process is stopping.
 * @param report - Sanitized report carried by a reported error, or `undefined` for an unclassified
 * failure.
 * @param errorName - Allowlisted classification of the failure itself.
 * @returns A `bot.failed` record, plus per-workflow records and failed readiness checks when the
 * report identifies them.
 * @remarks This is the only signal for the two failures no cycle record can describe: a readiness
 * check that fails during startup, before any monitor loop begins, and a fail-together lifecycle
 * where one of the three supervised workflows ends and stops its peers. Without it the shipped
 * stream shows a start and a stop with nothing between them. The reports are read structurally
 * because each reported error carries a different shape; anything unrecognized still yields the
 * top-level record.

 * Every variant carries a stable `event` discriminator, and every payload field is a top-level
 * scalar so Better Stack metric expressions can group on it. Two rules hold across the union and are
 * enforced by construction rather than by types:
 *
 * - **Units.** Every `*Assets` field is an unsigned raw smallest-unit amount of the configured
 *   `loanAsset`, and every `*Bps` field is an integer basis-point value. Both serialize as decimal
 *   strings because the bot-kit logger flattens `bigint` before shipping. The bot never reads token
 *   decimals, so no field is human-scaled.
 * - **Cardinality.** Only `workflow`, `marketId`, `side`, `status`, `stage`, `action`, `reason`,
 *   `check`, `bound`, `cap`, `operation`, `state`, and `referenceMode` may be used as
 *   grouping dimensions. `txHash` and `groupId` are unbounded trace-only correlation fields and must
 *   never be grouped on. Error text never appears — only allowlisted `errorName` classifications.

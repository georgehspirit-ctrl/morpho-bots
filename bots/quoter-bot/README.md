# Quoter bot

The bot validates its chain and Midnight setup, bootstraps target lending positions, maintains
two-sided rate ladders, and provides explicit recovery commands. Start with read-only mode to inspect
every intended action before enabling signing.

See [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for the contributor-facing package design and code
structure.

## Install from npm

The bot ships on npm as [`@morpho-org/quoter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@morpho-org/quoter):
one self-contained, dependency-free bundle installing the `morpho-quoter` command. It requires
Node.js 24.14.1 or newer.

```sh
npm install -g @morpho-org/quoter
```

```sh
# Read-only readiness checks against the configured maker address (no key required).
morpho-quoter --readonly setup-check

# Inspect every intended ladder action without signing or submitting anything.
morpho-quoter --readonly ladder --monitor --verbose

# Run setup checks, position bootstrap, and ladder monitoring together until SIGINT/SIGTERM.
morpho-quoter start --verbose
```

Configuration is identical in every distribution: the CLI discovers `quoter-bot.yaml` (then
`quoter-bot.yml`) in the working directory, takes an explicit file with `--config <path>`, and
reads the environment variables documented below — see [Configuration](#configuration). The
[Docker image](#deploy) `morphoorg/quoter` and the workspace invocation below run the same CLI, so
every `morpho-quoter <arguments>` example in this document can also be run as
`pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- <arguments>` from a repository checkout.

## Parameter playground

Run the stateless parameter playground locally from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm run quoter-bot:playground
```

The launcher performs a frozen-lockfile dependency check before every build, then prints the local
server URL after building the browser artifact. For a production-equivalent
build without starting a server, run:

```sh
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run playground:build
```

After this pull request is merged to `main`, relevant playground, browser-safe bot-kit, package, lock,
or deployment-workflow changes deploy through GitHub Actions to
<https://morpho-org.github.io/morpho-bots/>. Repository Pages settings must use **GitHub Actions** as
the publishing source; the workflow intentionally cannot change that repository setting with its
least-privilege token. The Pages site is not live until that post-merge workflow completes
successfully; check the repository's **Deploy quoter-bot playground to GitHub Pages** workflow and
its `github-pages` environment for deployment status.

## Run

```sh
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- setup-check

# Address-only setup inspection: MAKER_PRIVATE_KEY may be omitted.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --readonly setup-check

# Explicit signer sources (root options precede the command).
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --private-key '<key>' setup-check
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --keystore ./maker.json --interactive setup-check
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --aws setup-check
```

For unattended keystore operation, provision `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` separately through the deployment
secret manager or process environment, then run the keystore command without an inline value:

```sh
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --keystore ./maker.json setup-check
```

`--private-key <key>` and `--password <password>` remain available for explicit automation, but they
place secrets in argv, where process listings and shell history may expose them. Prefer
`MAKER_PRIVATE_KEY` and `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` respectively for unattended operation, or hidden
`--interactive` password input for attended keystore operation.

```sh
# Repeat read-only readiness checks every minute until SIGINT/SIGTERM.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- setup-check --monitor

# Emit compact JSON Lines for automation instead of the default human-readable output.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --json setup-check

# One live position-bootstrap cycle.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- bootstrap

# One address-only cycle that logs desired make operations without submitting them.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --readonly bootstrap

# Repeat bootstrap every minute; SIGINT/SIGTERM drains the current cycle and removes owned offers.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- bootstrap --monitor

# Stream full safe diagnostics and emit publication/cancellation hashes as soon as submitted.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- bootstrap --monitor --verbose

# Exercise the complete monitor and cleanup lifecycle without signing or submitting.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --readonly bootstrap --monitor

# Validate and continuously render ladder decisions without loading a private key or submitting.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- ladder --monitor --verbose --readonly

# Sign, broadcast, and confirm one ladder reconciliation cycle.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- ladder

# Continuously reconcile the live ladder and remove owned offers on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- ladder --monitor --verbose

# Run setup checks, bootstrap, and ladder monitoring together until SIGINT/SIGTERM.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- start --verbose

# Exercise the same combined lifecycle without signing or submitting transactions.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --readonly start --verbose

# Cancel every active offer group for the configured maker.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- invalidate

# Cancel one explicit offer group, even when it has not been indexed by the API.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- invalidate 0x<64-hex-characters>

# Preview the active groups that maker-wide invalidation would cancel.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- invalidate --readonly
```

Success exits zero and writes human-readable output to standard output. Add the root `--json` flag for
compact JSON Lines suitable for automation. In JSON mode, ordinary commands emit one report record;
a read-only writer command emits zero or more `readonly.make` records followed by its final cycle
report. Consumers must parse stdout one line at a time rather than as one JSON document. Bigints are
serialized as decimal strings. Failures always produce an explicit error on standard error and exit
non-zero; with `--json`, that error is one `quoter-bot.error` JSON record with optional structured
details. Any failed check throws `SetupFailedError` and identifies the failed check names. The check is
strictly read-only; remediation transaction descriptions are reported but never submitted. With
`--readonly`, signer-only checks are reported as `not-required`; maker balance, allowance, ratifier,
chain, market, reference, and active-offer observations still run.

`setup-check --monitor` runs the same complete read-only observation every minute and streams each
report. A report containing only explicitly transient provider failures is retried up to two
times within the cycle; recovery emits only the successful report. An invariant or mixed failure
emits `ready: false`, halts monitoring, includes that report in the terminal `setup-failed`
record, and exits with code `1`. A transient-only report that survives its in-cycle retries is
emitted as `ready: false` and retried on the next interval for up to ten consecutive cycles
before halting the same way, because halting cancels every live offer and a provider outage
must not cost the book. `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` after successful checks lets an
in-flight check finish and emits a final `{"status":"stopped","reason":"signal","cycles":N}` record
with exit code `0`. Monitoring never signs, submits remediation, or performs shutdown cleanup. Add
the root `--readonly` flag when signer checks should be omitted.

Read-only writer commands serialize desired bootstrap and ladder reconcile, hard-halt, and cleanup
requests as one JSON line with event name `readonly.make`. They never sign or submit an operation.
The `--readonly bootstrap` command executes one complete observational decision cycle after deriving
its exact tick, comparing the prospective offer with the complete current maker book, and applying
the SDK's live Mempool-policy validation without signing or broadcasting.
The corresponding final cycle outcome uses `status: "logged"` rather than `"applied"`.

`bootstrap --monitor` requires at least one explicit `bootstrap` / `BOOTSTRAP_MARKETS` entry. Each
market independently selects `targetRate.strategy: variable_rate_avg` (the existing Morpho Blue
variable-rate average) or `hardcoded` with `hardcodedRateBps`; `premiumBps` — plus the optional
`maturityPremium` term derived from the market's live time to maturity — is then added to derive
the published offer rate. It serially runs a cycle every minute
and streams each result. `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` lets an in-flight cycle finish, then invalidates every
explicitly owned bootstrap group through the same mutation queue and waits for bounded transaction
receipts. The final record reports the number of cycles and whether cleanup was applied, logged, or
failed. Read-only monitoring logs the cleanup request and never loads a private key. In live mode,
Ecrecover bootstrap signs and publishes the validated payload in one transaction. Setter bootstrap
durably reserves the future group, confirms any replacement cancellations, submits and confirms
`setIsRootRatified`, revalidates the exact final proof payload with the Mempool API, then publishes it
in a second transaction and confirms ownership. A post-approval validation failure does not publish
and retains the reservation for safe cleanup.

Add `--verbose` to either one-shot or monitored bootstrap mode to include the complete market
configuration, fresh credit, debt, cash balance, per-market and total exposure, active offer,
reference rate (with its seconds to maturity when a maturity premium is configured), the resolved
maturity premium, premium-adjusted target rate, deterministic decision, desired bootstrap offer, and
a fresh position read after every check. Live mode immediately emits a
`bootstrap.transaction-submitted` record when the wallet returns each ratification, publication, or cancellation
hash. Completed results also list confirmed transaction hashes in submission order, and verbose
monitor cleanup reports its confirmed cancellation hashes. These diagnostics deliberately omit the
maker identity, private key, RPC/API URLs, signatures, raw transactions, provider payloads, and
untrusted error text. Without `--verbose`, bootstrap output and provider-read volume remain
unchanged.

`ladder` requires at least one `ladder` / `LADDER_MARKETS` entry. It runs readiness first, derives
fresh wallet, allowance, credit, position, active-group, and strategy-wide exposure capacities, and
then builds one deterministic quote set from that market's independently selected target-rate
strategy. Lower-rate rungs are
reduce-only borrow-side sells; higher-rate rungs are lend-side buys. The complete mixed-side tree is
Mempool-validated before and after ratification. Ecrecover trees are signed and published in one
transaction; Setter trees first submit and confirm `setIsRootRatified`, then publish the proof-only
payload in a second transaction. Replacement
reserves the future group IDs durably, verifies the resulting whole maker book has positive spread,
confirms cancellation receipts for old owned groups, and only then broadcasts the replacement.
`ladder --readonly` performs the same readiness, state, rate, and decision reads, reconstructs any
active owned quote set, builds the exact prospective tree, applies unsigned Mempool policy and
whole-book spread validation, and only then emits the requested reconciliation without signing or
writing.

`ladder --monitor` repeats non-overlapping checks at the shortest `loopIntervalSeconds` configured
across its markets. `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` lets the current cycle and receipt handling finish, then
invalidates every active owned ladder group through the same serialized mutation queue. Any failed
or halted cycle stops monitoring, still attempts cleanup, prints the terminal halted report, and
exits with code `1`. Read-only monitoring emits the cleanup request without signing or submitting.

`ladder --verbose` includes the validated market config, current capacities and active quote, the
reference rate (with its seconds to maturity when a maturity premium is configured), the resolved
maturity premium, the premium-adjusted target rate, exact desired ladder, decision, confirmed
transaction hashes, and a fresh state read after every check. Live transaction hashes are also
emitted immediately as `ladder.transaction-submitted` records.

`start` requires at least one configured bootstrap market and one configured ladder market. It runs
the readiness gate before constructing either writer, then launches setup monitoring, position
bootstrap monitoring, and ladder monitoring concurrently. Cycle records are tagged with
`event: "quoter-bot.cycle"` and their `workflow`; verbose transaction records retain the existing
bootstrap and ladder event names. The first halted, rejected, or unexpectedly stopped workflow
aborts its peers, waits for both writer monitors to drain their in-flight cycles and cleanup owned
offers, and emits one combined terminal report. Bootstrap and ladder reads remain concurrent, while
their reconcile, hard-halt, and cleanup operations are serialized to prevent signer-nonce and book
mutation races. A normal SIGINT or SIGTERM returns `status: "stopped"`; any workflow failure
returns `status: "halted"` and exits with code `1`.

`invalidate` is an explicit recovery command and does not run the normal offer-readiness gate. With
no group argument it reads the complete active maker group set and invalidates every distinct group,
including groups that are not owned by the bootstrap or ladder strategy. Because one Midnight group
can cap several offers, one cancellation invalidates every offer in that group. With an optional
0x-prefixed bytes32 argument, `invalidate <group-id>` directly invalidates only that group without
depending on API indexing. Before a live cancellation it still verifies the connected chain,
deployed configured Midnight contract, signer identity and nonce, signer authorization, and the
maker and signer gas reserves. Maker-wide invalidation submits one zero-value native Midnight
`multicall(bytes[])`; each
ordered inner call is exactly `setConsumed(groupId, MAX_OFFER_CAP, MAKER_ADDRESS)`. Midnight executes
the inner calls with `delegatecall`, so the authorized signer that submits the outer transaction
remains `msg.sender` throughout while every `onBehalf` value remains the maker. The local transaction
policy rejects any wrong target, selector, call count,
order, group, amount, on-behalf account, or extra calldata. A reverted or failed multicall is reported
without serial retry. Explicit single-group invalidation keeps the simpler direct Midnight
`setConsumed` transaction. Successfully canceled bot-owned groups are removed from durable
ownership state; explicitly configured `V0_OFFER_GROUP_IDS` remain configuration-owned until the
operator edits configuration. If the provider omits one of these configured groups, bootstrap and
ladder reads deliberately fail closed because neither omission nor ordinary partial on-chain
consumption reveals the group's original maximum capacity. A `consumed` value equal to the Midnight
SDK's `MAX_OFFER_CAP` is the exception: it conclusively proves invalidation, so readers ignore that
group and cleanup does not resubmit its cancellation after a restart. Remove stale IDs from
`V0_OFFER_GROUP_IDS` after invalidation to keep the operator-owned set current.

Maker-wide invalidation waits for the single multicall receipt, reports its hash against every group,
then forgets all confirmed bot-owned groups together. Submitted hashes stream as
`offer-invalidation.transaction-submitted` records and are retained in the terminal success or
failure report. A failed atomic multicall exits with code `1` and reports the same submitted hash for
every selected group. `invalidate --readonly` performs the cancellation preflight and, for maker-wide
scope, lists the active groups, but never loads a private key, submits transactions, or edits
ownership state. Normal bootstrap and ladder invalidation loops remain serial; native multicall is
limited to the explicit maker-wide recovery command.

For a maker with at least 101 USDC of both available balance and accrued credit, this
one-rung-per-side preset caps each side at 150 USDC. USDC uses six decimals, so `150000000` is 150
USDC and `101000000` is the Router-compatible 101 USDC offer floor. Duplicate the exact market ID
already present in `MARKET_IDS`. This legacy preset intentionally omits `targetRate`, so it uses the
backward-compatible `variable_rate_avg` default:

```dotenv
LADDER_MARKETS=[{"marketId":"0x05959752fdeff325962b9d263edb421efc6e2186a49360dba6c32e86ebf6c84c","quotePremiumBps":"0","spreadBps":"200","stepBps":"100","rungCount":"1","sizeSkewBps":"0","lowerRateBudgetAssets":"150000000","higherRateBudgetAssets":"150000000","targetMarketExposureAssets":"300000000","maximumTotalExposureAssets":"300000000","minimumOfferAssets":"101000000","groupMode":"shared-rung","loopIntervalSeconds":"60","movementToleranceBps":"10","minimumRateBps":"200","maximumRateBps":"800"}]
```

Run the exact read-only monitor command first to inspect whether current cash/credit capacity
produces a lower side, a higher side, or both:

```sh
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- ladder --monitor --verbose --readonly
```

Version output remains available:

```sh
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --version
```

## Deploy

The package owns its production [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile), local
[docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml), Kubernetes [Helm chart](./helm/quoter-bot), and
idempotent [`scripts/deploy-railway.ts`](./scripts/deploy-railway.ts) entrypoint. The Docker build
context is the repository root so pnpm can resolve every workspace dependency; a build stage
compiles the workspace, and the runtime stage ships only this bot's self-contained bundle — no
other bot's code, workspace source, or package manager — and starts the combined setup, bootstrap,
and ladder monitor as an unprivileged Node process. Kubernetes operators should deploy the
published Docker Hub image through the package-owned Helm chart — see
[Kubernetes (Helm)](#kubernetes-helm).

Each supported chain runs as its own Railway service, `quoter-bot-<chainId>` (`quoter-bot-1`,
`quoter-bot-8453`), inside one project. A full deployment provisions the single chain named by
`CHAIN_ID`: it creates that chain's service, selects the package Dockerfile, provisions a persistent
volume at `/state`, and writes the effective environment configuration through stdin so values never
appear in process arguments or logs. Every input keeps its unsuffixed runtime name, so run it once
per chain with that chain's environment:

```sh
RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID=... CHAIN_ID=1 \
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run deploy:railway
```

Provide the required values from [`.env.example`](./.env.example) in the invoking environment.
A full provisioning run supports only `private-key`, because the script cannot safely seed a local
keystore file or an AWS credential source into a newly created service. For `keystore`, first
provision the encrypted file at `KEYSTORE_PATH` in the existing service. For `aws`, first provision
an AWS SDK credential source with direct `kms:GetPublicKey` and `kms:Sign` access in the existing
service. Then set the corresponding
signer variables out of band and use `DEPLOY_ONLY=true`; deploy-only does not inspect or mutate those
credentials or files. Full provisioning fails closed for these modes instead of launching a service
that cannot resolve its signer.

`BOOTSTRAP_MARKETS` and `LADDER_MARKETS` must each be populated JSON arrays so a full run cannot
replace a working strategy with an empty list. Every remaining optional value is synchronized:
omitted timeouts return to their documented defaults, and omitted group IDs and BetterStack settings
are disabled. `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` defaults to `production`. CI uses `DEPLOY_ONLY=true` with the
`quoter-bot-production` GitHub Environment, so it reads only `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID` and
`RAILWAY_TOKEN` and uses project-token deployment permissions to re-ship every supported chain's
pre-provisioned service. Deploy-only cannot create a service: it fails before any upload, naming the
chain services a full run has not yet provisioned. It starts every service before waiting on any, so
one chain's failure never blocks another's re-ship, and it fails when any service does not reach
`SUCCESS`. Deploy-only does not inspect or mutate Railway variables, volumes, or secrets. Before
deploy-only, an authorized operator or full provisioning run must configure, on each chain's service,
`RAILWAY_RUN_UID=0`, the current `RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH=bots/quoter-bot/Dockerfile`,
`XDG_STATE_HOME=/state`, signer and application variables, and the state volume. A full
provisioning run preserves root-level ownership files in an attached volume at `/state`; when none
is attached, it creates a fresh volume there and leaves any detached pre-rename volume untouched. A project token (`RAILWAY_TOKEN`) cannot
manage that configuration; use authorized account or workspace credentials only for provisioning,
not routine deploy-only CI.

The local Compose service uses the same `/state` ownership path through a named volume, requires both
strategy arrays, and supplies the runtime timeout defaults when the corresponding host variables are
absent.

Both modes start a detached upload, read the deployment ID Railway reports for it, and poll that
deployment to a terminal state. A GitHub release is created only after Railway reports `SUCCESS`;
failed, crashed, approval-blocked, removed, skipped, sleeping, unknown, or timed-out deployments
fail the workflow.

A production release (a merged PR whose description says `Releases quoter-bot`, approved after that
line was added) also publishes the image to Docker Hub as `morphoorg/quoter`, tagged with the release
commit hash and `latest`. The push runs in the public `morpho-org/morpho-bots` repository, from the
`quoter-bot-*` tag the release mirror creates there, and gates neither the deploy nor the GitHub
release. The **Publish quoter-bot Docker Hub** workflow publishes only a tag whose commit is on
first-parent `main` and carries the mirror's `Source-Ref:` trailer, and authenticates through the
Docker organization's OIDC connection scoped by the `quoter-bot-dockerhub` GitHub Environment
(secret `DOCKERHUB_OIDC_CONNECTIONID`, vars `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_REPOSITORY`), so CI
stores no static Docker Hub credential.

Before each build, the workflow checks Docker's registry API and fails closed when the commit-SHA
tag already exists or the registry returns an unexpected status. A rerun therefore cannot replace
an image already associated with a release commit. `latest` only moves forward: when a
`quoter-bot-*` release tag descends from the built commit, a rerun backfills that commit's image
tag without touching `latest`.

### npm publishing

A production release also publishes the CLI to npm as
[`@morpho-org/quoter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@morpho-org/quoter) when
[`package.json`](./package.json)`#version` was bumped. When the release mirror pushes the
`quoter-bot-*` tag to the public `morpho-org/morpho-bots` repository, the **Publish quoter-bot npm**
workflow there — standalone because npm trusted publishing validates the top-level workflow
filename — verifies that the tagged commit is a mirror release snapshot on first-parent `main`,
stages the package with
`pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run npm:pack`, smoke-tests that the staged CLI reports the
staged manifest version, and publishes through npm trusted publishing (OIDC), so CI stores no npm
token. Every publish carries a provenance attestation naming the release commit: a tag push's
event commit is that commit, and a recovery dispatch must select the release tag as the workflow
ref — a run whose event commit differs is refused rather than published unattested.

The staged package (`dist/npm/`) contains exactly the self-contained bundle renamed to
`morpho-quoter.js`, a generated dependency-free manifest, the repository LICENSE, and
[`docs/npm-README.md`](./docs/npm-README.md); the private workspace manifest never reaches the
registry. Published versions are immutable: a release whose version already exists on the registry
completes as a no-op, so bumping `version` in the release PR is what opts a release into an npm
publish. Dist-tags only move forward: a rerun whose commit has a newer descendant release tag
publishes under `backfill` (stable or prerelease), a remaining prerelease takes the `next`
dist-tag only when it semver-advances the registry's current `next`, and a stable version must be
semver-greater than the registry's current `latest` to take that tag; non-advancing versions
publish under `backfill`.

One-time setup: npm cannot create a brand-new package through trusted publishing, so a maintainer
bootstraps the first publish manually
(`pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run npm:pack && npm publish bots/quoter-bot/dist/npm` from
the repository root), then configures the package's trusted publisher on npmjs.com (repository
`morpho-org/morpho-bots`, workflow `publish-quoter-bot-npm.yml`, environment `quoter-bot-npm`) and
creates the `quoter-bot-npm` GitHub Environment there with its deployment policy scoped to
`quoter-bot-*` tags.

### Kubernetes (Helm)

The [`helm/quoter-bot`](./helm/quoter-bot) chart is the recommended way to self-host the bot on
Kubernetes from the public `morphoorg/quoter:latest` image. The chart is consumed directly from
this repository checkout — it is not published to any Helm registry yet — so install it from the
local path. One values file fully configures a deployment: classic workload parameters (image,
CPU/memory resources, persistence, scheduling) sit next to a `config` mapping holding the bot's
complete native YAML configuration — the same schema as
[`quoter-bot.example.yaml`](./quoter-bot.example.yaml) — which the chart renders into a Secret and
passes to the bot with `--config`. Because environment values override YAML values, the chart's
`env`/`envFrom` parameters keep the maker signing secret and the environment-only Better Stack
variables out of that block.

From the repository root:

```sh
helm lint bots/quoter-bot/helm/quoter-bot

helm install quoter-bot bots/quoter-bot/helm/quoter-bot \
  --namespace quoter-bot --create-namespace --values my-values.yaml

helm upgrade quoter-bot bots/quoter-bot/helm/quoter-bot \
  --namespace quoter-bot --values my-values.yaml
```

The chart runs a one-replica StatefulSet because the bot is a singleton writer — a replacement
pod is never created until the old one has fully terminated, across rollouts, manual deletion,
and eviction alike. It mounts a persistent volume at `/state` for durable offer-group ownership
state (kept on uninstall by default), runs the bundle directly as the image's unprivileged
`node` user instead of the root-only Railway entrypoint, and sizes the termination grace period
(1020 seconds by default, automatically floored for a chart-managed configuration to one
receipt timeout per serialized shutdown wait — three per bootstrap market, two per ladder
market, one per ladder group, and two cleanup batches — plus a drain buffer) so shutdown
cleanup can invalidate owned groups and wait for receipts. An upgrade that
changes `config` rolls the pod automatically. See the
[chart README](./helm/quoter-bot/README.md) for the full parameter reference, a complete values
example, and secret-handling options.

## Configuration

### Configuration sources and precedence

Configuration can come from environment variables, a YAML file, or both. YAML files and the
`BOOTSTRAP_MARKETS` and `LADDER_MARKETS` values are each limited to 1 MiB before parsing.

1. `--config <path>` selects that exact `.yaml` or `.yml` file. Other path extensions and a missing,
   unreadable, empty, oversized, malformed, symlinked, or non-regular explicitly named file fail
   startup. Default-discovered symlinks are rejected as unreadable too.
2. Without `--config`, the CLI searches the process working directory from which `morpho-quoter`
   was invoked. It checks `quoter-bot.yaml` first, then `quoter-bot.yml`. If both exist, `.yaml`
   wins.
3. If neither default file exists, environment-only startup remains supported.
4. Every supplied environment variable overrides the corresponding YAML value. CLI signer flags
   override environment and YAML signer selection. A higher-precedence signer selection discards
   competing lower-precedence signer fields while retaining same-method companion fields. Within one
   effective layer, configuring more than one source is an error.

Scalar fields override independently. `MARKET_IDS` and `V0_OFFER_GROUP_IDS` each replace their
complete YAML list. `BOOTSTRAP_MARKETS` and `LADDER_MARKETS` replace the complete YAML `bootstrap` and
`ladder` lists respectively; arrays are never partially or positionally merged. YAML syntax and
source-safety checks run before overlay,
then only the effective merged configuration is semantically validated, so replaced invalid values do
not block startup while parser hazards in replaced sections still do.

Use [`quoter-bot.example.yaml`](./quoter-bot.example.yaml) as the complete YAML template and
[`.env.example`](./.env.example) as the environment template. Default discovery never selects the
example filename.

```sh
# Explicit file; relative paths resolve from the invocation working directory.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --config ./quoter-bot.yml setup-check

# Default discovery in the current working directory.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- setup-check

# Address-only mode works with either configuration source.
pnpm --filter @morpho-org/quoter-bot run start -- --readonly setup-check
```

Two unit conventions apply everywhere: amounts are **raw loan-token units** (for six-decimal USDC,
`101000000` is 101 USDC) and rates are **integer basis points** (`100` = one percentage point).

### Environment variables

Every supported environment variable is listed below. “Raw assets” means the loan token's smallest
unit; for six-decimal USDC, `101000000` is 101 USDC. No value is inferred from another variable.

| Environment variable                | YAML key                              | Requirement and behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

There is no separate Mempool endpoint or API-key field. Books and cursor-paginated maker offer groups
are read through `MORPHO_API_BASE_URL`. Ratifier identity is validated from the pinned Morpho SDK
catalog, so setup readiness does not depend on a Router API endpoint. `ROUTER_API_BASE_URL` and
`apis.routerBaseUrl` remain accepted as ignored compatibility keys for existing deployments.

### Better Stack observability

Set both `BETTERSTACK_SOURCE_TOKEN` and `BETTERSTACK_INGESTING_HOST` to ship sanitized named
monitoring records to Better Stack. Records written through the CLI event writer pass an explicit
allowlist: only the event names in `MONITORING_EVENT_NAMES` plus `ladder.transaction-submitted`,
`bootstrap.transaction-submitted`, and `offer-invalidation.transaction-submitted` cross that
boundary. Everything else the CLI writes stays local — the `quoter-bot.cycle` cycle envelope and
`readonly.make` are named but nested and unversioned, so they are stdout-only, and the terminal
monitor report is never shipped (it lands on stdout on success and on stderr on the failure path,
attached to `quoter-bot.error`). Their content is available as the flat `cycle.completed`,
`guardrail.*`, and `bot.failed` records. Separately, `@repo/observability` and `@repo/bot-kit` emit
`bot.started`, `bot.stopped`, `bot.unexpected-error`, and `heartbeat.failed` straight through the
shipping logger, bypassing the allowlist, so those four are in the log source too. Shipping is
best-effort and never replaces or suppresses the existing stdout/stderr JSON Lines contract. With
full shipping configuration, `start`, `bootstrap`, and `ladder` automatically enable the existing
safe `--verbose` event stream (without adding a duplicate flag), so active positions, bootstrap
offers, ladder quotes/offers, decisions, and submitted/confirmed transactions are available to the
log source. With the shipping variables unset no log record leaves the process; partial
configuration fails loud locally and does not enable verbose diagnostics.

Every record carries `bot: "quoter-bot"`, the configured `chainId`, and available Railway deployment
context. `schemaVersion` is bound into the logger context of every record (currently `1`), so a
consumer can pin the contract; it is bumped only on a breaking field rename or removal. Nested
`status: "failed"`, `status: "halted"`, and `errorName` values are emitted at error level.
Unexpected failures include only a sanitized `errorName`; private keys, RPC/API credentials, signed
or raw transaction payloads, provider payloads, and untrusted raw error messages are never added to
observability records.

Useful Better Stack source queries/filters include:

- lifecycle and restarts: `bot:quoter-bot AND event:(bot.started OR bot.stopped OR bot.failed)`;
- configured scope: `bot:quoter-bot AND event:(bot.configured OR market.configured)`;
- monitor cycles: `bot:quoter-bot AND event:cycle.completed` plus `workflow`, `action`, or `status`;
- failures: `bot:quoter-bot AND level:error`, optionally grouped by `event` and `errorName`.

`BETTERSTACK_HEARTBEAT_URL` is optional and configured independently of the shipping opt-in: when it
is set the heartbeat pings on a wall-clock interval whether or not shipping is configured, so
"shipping unset" means no log records are sent, not that the process makes no network calls. It
starts with the process, stops during normal teardown, and cannot interrupt strategy execution.
Create the log source, heartbeat, saved queries, and any dashboard/alerting in Better Stack
externally; this repository does not provision or claim a deployed dashboard URL.

Every shipped record carries a named top-level `event` and a flat scalar payload, so Better Stack
metric expressions can group on it; the `bot.action` fallback is unreachable for this bot.

**Units.** Every `*Assets` field is an unsigned raw smallest-unit amount of the configured
`loanAsset`. Every `*Bps` field is an integer basis-point value. Both serialize as decimal strings
because the bot-kit logger flattens `bigint` before shipping. The bot never reads token decimals, so
no field is human-scaled — resolve decimals downstream from the `loanAsset` address in
`bot.configured`.

`txHash` and `groupId` are unbounded trace-only correlation fields: use them to join records, never
as grouping dimensions. The safe dimensions are `workflow`, `marketId`, `side`, `status`, `stage`,
`action`, `reason`, `check`, `bound`, `cap`, `operation`, `state`, `referenceMode`, and
`guardrail.book-crossed`'s `clearable` and `suppressed`.
Guardrail records are aggregated per side per cycle and emitted only when the count is non-zero,
because a side can hold up to 512 rungs and regenerate every second. Error text never ships — only
allowlisted `errorName` classifications.

Absence alerts are scoped per market by `market.configured`, which names the market and its own
`ladderIntervalSeconds`; a single process-wide interval would make slower markets look overdue.
`bot.configured` scopes the process-wide `bootstrapIntervalSeconds`.

**Known limits.**

- Everything beyond `cycle.completed`, `guardrail.halted`, `setup.check-failed`, and
  `setup.check-warning` requires
  `--verbose`. Full shipping configuration auto-enables it; running `start`, `bootstrap`, or `ladder`
  manually without `--verbose` yields far fewer records.
- Fills are diffed from monotonic per-group `consumed`. A group first seen establishes a baseline and
  emits nothing, so a restart loses one cycle of fill telemetry.
- `offer.consumed.groupRateBps` is the configured rate of the group's rung nearest the center, not
  the rate that executed. Under `groupMode: per-book` every rung on a side shares one protocol group,
  so it is only the best of several shared rates; and because publication aligns a rate to the
  market's tick spacing, it can differ slightly from the published rate on either mode.
- `position.observed.maturityTimestamp` is projected from maker groups already read this cycle rather
  than a dedicated market read, so it is absent when the maker holds no indexed group in that market.
- `book.observed.state` is `quoting` or `empty` only: `readActive` reconstructs indexed and
  not-yet-indexed groups into one quote set, so a pending-index state is not observable at this seam.
- Bootstrap does not always read a reference. `decidePositionBootstrapTransition` decides before any
  rate derivation once the credit target is reached, or once the initial target completed with
  `autoRefill` off, and `reference.observed` is emitted only when a verbose cycle holds a reference
  rate — so for a bootstrap-only market its absence often means "not needed" rather than "stale".
  A ladder market reads a reference every cycle.
- Monitoring cannot halt quoting. Records are derived and written inside the monitored cycle's own
  callback, but `writeCycle` swallows any failure raised while projecting or writing them: telemetry
  can be lost silently, and a broken projection can never stop a cycle.
- Shutdown cleanup cancellations ship pre-receipt `ladder.transaction-submitted` /
  `bootstrap.transaction-submitted` records but no `transaction.settled` counterpart: confirmed
  hashes exist only on the terminal monitor report, which is not shipped. A failed cleanup remains
  alertable as `bot.failed` with `reason: "cleanup-failed"`.
- `cycle.completed.durationMs` covers one market's check including the post-check verbose re-read.
  Under the combined `start` lifecycle the ladder and bootstrap writers share one mutation queue, so
  it can include queue wait.

### YAML schema

The root accepts exactly `chain`, `identity`, `contracts`, `apis`, `markets`, `setup`, `bootstrap`,
and `ladder`; unknown keys at any level are rejected. Every supported key appears in
[`quoter-bot.example.yaml`](./quoter-bot.example.yaml).

- `chain`: `id`, `rpcUrl`, `archiveRpcUrl`.
- `identity`: `makerAddress`, `keyStorageMethod`, `makerPrivateKey`, `keystorePath`,
  `keystorePassword`, `keystoreInteractive`, `awsKmsKeyId`, `awsRegion`.
- `contracts`: `midnightAddress`, `loanAssetAddress`, `ratifierAddress`.
- `apis`: `morphoBaseUrl`, `routerBaseUrl`.
- `markets`: `allowlist`, `referenceMarketId`, `referenceLookbackSeconds`, `v0OfferGroupIds`.
- `setup`: `nativeReserveWei`, `signerNativeReserveWei`, `maxFeeGwei`, `priorityFeeGwei`,
  `maxTransactionSpendWei`, `maxPublicationGas`, `maxPublicationDataBytes`, `maxCancellationGas`,
  `maxBatchCancellationGas`, `maxBatchCancellationDataBytes`, `maxRatificationGas`,
  `requestTimeoutMs`, `transactionReceiptTimeoutMs`.
- `bootstrap`: an ordered list of the exact per-market objects documented below.
- `ladder`: an ordered list of the exact per-market objects documented below.

`setup.maximumLendExposureAssets` was removed. Delete it from existing configuration files:
unknown keys are rejected and the sanitized error does not name the offending key, so a stale entry
crash-loops the bot at startup with no indication of which line is at fault. A stale
`MAXIMUM_LEND_EXPOSURE_ASSETS` environment variable is inert and needs no action — the loader reads
an allowlist and ignores anything outside it.

Addresses and bytes32 IDs should be quoted YAML strings. Every integer field uses exact
decimal-integer syntax: unsigned fields accept digits only, while `premiumBps`, `quotePremiumBps`,
and `sizeSkewBps` additionally accept one leading minus. Exact raw-unit amounts may be quoted decimal
strings or bare YAML decimal integers without precision loss. Floats, exponent notation, leading
plus signs, surrounding whitespace inside quoted integers, negative unsigned amounts, wrong
scalar/list/object types, duplicate keys or IDs, aliases, custom tags, prototype keys, unsupported
keys, and malformed YAML are rejected. Rates and premiums are integer basis points (`100` = one
percentage point); floats are never coerced. Each YAML `autoRefill` value must be the unquoted
lowercase plain scalar `true` or `false`. Environment integer values follow the same decimal syntax
after outer environment whitespace is trimmed.

### Setup checks

Setup verifies all of the following from the typed configuration:

- Configured chain identity and configured Midnight bytecode.
- The maker emergency-gas reserve, loan-token allowance, and ratifier authorization.
  The allowance check requires an unbounded (`type(uint256).max`) approval to Midnight: an ERC-20
  allowance is a cumulative lifetime spend budget, not an outstanding-exposure cap, so a finite
  approval is consumed by ordinary relending and fails readiness. Exposure is bounded by maker
  wallet funds and the strategy's `targetMarketExposureAssets` / `maximumTotalExposureAssets`.
- Active maker offers: an offer on an unconfigured market, or a crossed/inverted book, fails
  readiness. A live offer group the bot cannot attribute to itself is reported as `warning` and
  does not block readiness — group ownership is a local durable record, so redeploying onto a fresh
  filesystem orphans the bot's own groups, and halting on that cannot recover until every orphan
  expires. Exposure is derived from live on-chain groups either way.
- Signer identity, signer nonce, and the required identity relationship: local and keystore signers
  equal the maker; an AWS signer differs. AWS mode also checks the signer gas reserve and Midnight
  authorization. Signer-only checks are `not-required` with `--readonly`. Addresses are not included
  in operator output.
- Every allowlisted market is active, uses the configured loan asset, has valid tick spacing and
  maturity, and agrees between API and chain state.
- The exact Blue reference market is readable from the archive provider.
- Active offer groups belong to configured namespaces and markets and are not crossed/inverted.

`V0_OFFER_GROUP_IDS` is optional. Readiness and every writer use the same explicit ownership source:
configured IDs plus bot-issued IDs from the maker-and-market-bound state file. Publication first durably
reserves the SDK-derived group ID, broadcasts only after that write succeeds, and then promotes the
reservation to confirmed ownership. A failed broadcast removes its reservation; if confirmation storage
fails after a successful broadcast, the reservation remains sufficient to recognize the group from fresh
provider data without claiming that an absent group is live. A same-quoter group absent from these
sources remains unknown, fails readiness, and requires an operator decision; market membership alone never
permits reconciliation or hard-halt cancellation. The request timeout is an aggregate fetch/RPC bound and
does not reveal endpoint details in failures.

Bootstrap offer-group reads request the configured chain explicitly, ignore well-formed rows from other chains, and fail
closed on malformed chain identity, asset strings, or empty/repeated pagination cursors. The variable Blue
reference hard-fails when its latest checkpoint is more than five minutes behind wall-clock time, and
when either checkpoint lands on a block where the reference market does not yet exist or holds no
supply shares. Blue's virtual shares make that state indistinguishable from a market supplying at
par, so it is rejected rather than priced; widening `REFERENCE_LOOKBACK_SECONDS` widens the
historical interval in which such a block is reachable.

### Position-bootstrap fields

Each `bootstrap` entry must use a unique `marketId` present in `markets.allowlist`.
`targetRate` defaults to `{ strategy: "variable_rate_avg" }` when omitted for backward compatibility
and `maturityPremium` may be omitted entirely; every other field in each entry is required.

For a market below its accepted target, desired assets are the minimum of `offerSize`, remaining
credit target, cash balance, remaining per-market exposure, and remaining total exposure. Replacement
capacity excludes that market's representative live group while retaining every other active group's
exposure. Zero or negative capacity leaves no offer. The final requested rate is `reference rate +
premiumBps + maturity premium`; a result outside the inclusive hard range saturates at the nearest
bound instead of failing, so a reference-rate excursion can never halt the strategy.

`maturityPremium` makes each entry's premium a function of that market's remaining time to
maturity, so one bot can quote every configured maturity from one term structure: further maturity
= higher premium. The initial `linear` shape resolves
`floor(premiumPerYearBps × secondsToMaturity / 31,536,000)` from the fresh on-chain maturity and
latest Base block timestamp at every cycle, optionally capped by the inclusive `maximumPremiumBps`;
a market at or past maturity contributes zero. The resolved term is added on top of the signed
static `premiumBps` (urgency discount and duration compensation stay independently configured), so
long maturities can quote above the reference while `premiumBps` still anchors the short end. The
premium decays as maturity approaches; integer flooring keeps the requested rate stable for days at
a time, and a one-BPS step only republishes when it actually moves the canonical Midnight tick.
Additional function shapes may be added later; `shape` selects the active one. Both target-rate
strategies compose with it — a `hardcoded` reference with a maturity premium still decays along the
curve. Omit the object entirely to keep today's static-premium behavior.

Live reconciliation retains an owned offer when its assets, canonical Midnight tick, and continuous
fee cap still match, even if a raw reference-rate change produced the same tick. A market fee-policy
change therefore replaces an offer that is no longer takeable. Every genuinely new publication uses
the current block timestamp as its start, so replacing a consumed offer cannot recreate its
content-addressed group ID.

`BOOTSTRAP_MARKETS` uses an exact JSON array with the same fields; YAML syntax, duplicate object keys,
and prototype keys are rejected. Every integer-valued property—including asset amounts, exposure caps,
rates, `premiumBps`, and the nested `maturityPremium` integers—must be a quoted decimal-integer
string. JSON number tokens are rejected even
when integral; `marketId` remains a string, `autoRefill` remains a JSON boolean, and
`maturityPremium.shape` remains the JSON string `"linear"`. Supplying it replaces
every YAML bootstrap entry, which avoids ambiguous partial-array merge behavior. See
[`.env.example`](./.env.example) for exact syntax.

Bootstrap and ladder select their methods independently. These two valid YAML combinations show both
directions:

```yaml
# Bootstrap fixed at 4%; ladder follows the Blue variable-rate average.
bootstrap:
  - marketId: '0x...'
    targetRate: { strategy: 'hardcoded', hardcodedRateBps: '400' }
ladder:
  - marketId: '0x...'
    targetRate: { strategy: 'variable_rate_avg' }

# Bootstrap follows Blue; ladder is fixed at 4%.
bootstrap:
  - marketId: '0x...'
    targetRate: { strategy: 'variable_rate_avg' }
ladder:
  - marketId: '0x...'
    targetRate: { strategy: 'hardcoded', hardcodedRateBps: '400' }
```

`morpho-quoter setup-check --monitor` repeats non-overlapping read-only readiness observations every
minute until its shutdown signal or the first failed report after transient-provider retry tolerance.
`morpho-quoter bootstrap` first runs the same one-shot readiness gate as `setup-check`, then executes
exactly one position-bootstrap cycle and prints its
bigint-safe JSON result. `morpho-quoter bootstrap --monitor` uses the same gate, repeats non-overlapping
cycles every minute, and performs owned-group cleanup after its shutdown signal.
`morpho-quoter bootstrap --verbose` adds safe rate, offer, transaction-hash, configuration, and
before/after position diagnostics to each result. `morpho-quoter ladder --monitor` similarly repeats at the shortest configured ladder cadence,
streams cycles, and cleans active owned ladder groups after shutdown; `--verbose` adds safe
configuration, rate, quote, transaction-hash, and before/after capacity diagnostics. Version output,
setup monitoring, and invalid usage never start either writer.

Before a bootstrap cycle reads positions or publishes, it validates every configured market.
Invalid configuration, reference failures, and decision failures trigger a strategy-wide hard halt;
an ordinary position-read failure requests market-local invalidation and permits other markets to
continue. Receipt polling is bounded independently by `TRANSACTION_RECEIPT_TIMEOUT_MS`. Read-only
mode retains the same decisions and fresh prospective whole-book comparison but logs every requested
mutation and graceful-cleanup operation instead.

### Ladder fields and formulas

Each `ladder` entry has a unique allowlisted `marketId`. Rates are integer BPS and asset/exposure
amounts are exact raw loan-asset units. `quotePremiumBps` and `sizeSkewBps` are signed; all other
integer fields are nonnegative or positive as shown below. `targetRate` defaults to
`{ strategy: "variable_rate_avg" }`, `maturityPremium` may be omitted entirely, and
`bookCrossedCooldownSeconds` defaults to three loop intervals; every other field in each entry is
required.

| Field                        | Unit / behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Validation                                                                                                |

| `quotePremiumBps`            | Signed BPS added to the fresh reference rate before the ladder spread is applied. Positive moves both sides higher; negative moves both lower.                                                                       | Signed decimal integer; the resulting funded rungs must remain inside the configured rate range.          |
| `maturityPremium`            | Optional premium function of the market's time to maturity added to the effective center on top of `quotePremiumBps`.                                                                                                | Object with `shape: 'linear'`, positive `premiumPerYearBps`, optional positive `maximumPremiumBps`.       |
| `spreadBps`                  | Full distance in BPS between the nearest lower and higher rates. Each nearest rung is half this value from the center.                                                                                               | Positive and even, so each half-spread is an exact integer BPS value.                                     |
| `stepBps`                    | Additional BPS between successive rungs on the same side, moving farther from the center.                                                                                                                            | Positive.                                                                                                 |

| `sizeSkewBps`                | Signed change to each successive rung's allocation weight from the base weight `10000`. Positive favors outer rungs; negative favors inner rungs.                                                                    | Signed decimal integer; every configured rung weight must remain positive.                                |
| `lowerRateBudgetAssets`      | Maximum raw assets allocated across lower-rate rungs. This side posts reduce-only borrow-side sells and is additionally capped by the maker's accrued market credit.                                                 | Positive and at least `minimumOfferAssets`.                                                               |
| `higherRateBudgetAssets`     | Maximum raw assets allocated across higher-rate rungs. This side posts lend-side buys and is additionally capped by available balance, allowance, and exposure.                                                      | Positive and at least `minimumOfferAssets`.                                                               |
| `targetMarketExposureAssets` | Raw cap for credit plus reserved lend-buy liquidity in this market. It caps only the higher-rate, exposure-increasing side.                                                                                          | Positive and no greater than `maximumTotalExposureAssets`.                                                |

| `minimumOfferAssets`         | Smallest raw size permitted for any emitted rung. Capacity funds the closest rungs first and omits a side or outer rungs that cannot each meet this floor.                                                           | Positive and no greater than either configured side budget. Use at least `101000000` for USDC.            |
| `groupMode`                  | Consumption-cap grouping: `shared-rung` creates one independent group per rung; `per-book` creates one shared group for all funded rungs on each side.                                                               | Exactly `shared-rung` or `per-book`.                                                                      |
| `loopIntervalSeconds`        | Requested delay between completed monitor cycles for this market set; the monitor uses the shortest configured value.                                                                                                | Positive integer no greater than `2147483`, keeping the millisecond delay within the runtime timer limit. |
| `bookCrossedCooldownSeconds` | Seconds one side of the resting ladder waits between replacements triggered by a third party crossing it. Anchored to the block timestamp the replaced publication was prepared at, and held in process memory only. | Optional positive integer no greater than `2147483`; defaults to three times `loopIntervalSeconds`.       |
| `movementToleranceBps`       | Inclusive center-rate deadband. An existing center is retained until the effective center moves by strictly more than this value; capacity resizing still applies.                                                   | Nonnegative.                                                                                              |
| `minimumRateBps`             | Inclusive hard minimum for every funded final rung after premium, spread, and step offsets. A rung below it saturates at this bound.                                                                                 | Nonnegative and strictly less than `maximumRateBps`.                                                      |
| `maximumRateBps`             | Inclusive hard maximum for every funded final rung after premium, spread, and step offsets. A rung above it saturates at this bound.                                                                                 | Positive and strictly greater than `minimumRateBps`; the complete static ladder shape must fit.           |

The rung limit bounds local allocation to 1,024 offers for a two-sided ladder, a height-10 tree
below the Midnight SDK's height-20 protocol limit.

For reference `R`, effective center `C = R + quotePremiumBps + maturity premium` (the maturity term
is zero without a `maturityPremium`). With zero-based rung `k`:

```text
lower rate = C - spreadBps / 2 - k * stepBps
higher rate = C + spreadBps / 2 + k * stepBps
```

The complete static shape must fit between `minimumRateBps` and `maximumRateBps`. A runtime rung
walking outside that inclusive hard range saturates at the nearest bound instead of failing, so a
reference-rate excursion can never halt the strategy. A retained center is recentered only when
absolute effective-center movement is strictly greater than `movementToleranceBps`; capacity
changes still resize quotes inside that tolerance.

A rung that would cross an offer already resting on the market book is repriced to the nearest tick
just clear of it, so a large reference move compresses the affected side against the best opposing
offer instead of quoting through it. That clearance saturates at the same hard rate range as every
other rung: if the best opposing offer sits beyond `minimumRateBps` / `maximumRateBps`, no in-range
tick can clear it and the rung publishes at the bound, crossed, rather than outside the configured
rates. Publication refuses only a ladder that would cross an offer the maker itself owns, since that
is a self-trade; crossing a third party is a pricing concern, never a reason to fail the cycle. Own
bootstrap buys keep their own clearance and their deliberate tie at the bound.

The clearance itself is exact and lives in tick space, so it never appears as a rate, and rate-space
quote drift stays governed by `movementToleranceBps` alone. Every cycle additionally reports, per
side, whether a third party currently crosses the ladder resting on the book and whether the
configured rate window could still clear it (`guardrail.book-crossed`). A book the reader cannot parse leaves that signal absent for the cycle and
never withdraws the ladder. An opposing offer smaller than `minimumOfferAssets` at its own tick is dust and never counts as crossing, so a free-to-post
offer cannot buy a cancel-and-republish every cooldown. A side that is crossed,
clearable, and past its `bookCrossedCooldownSeconds` upgrades that cycle's `rest` into a replacement
with reason `book-crossed`. The crossing is then re-evaluated inside the mutation queue from a fresh
book before anything is reserved, cancelled, or signed: a cross that has already gone mutates
nothing and the cycle reports `rest`. The cooldown is per side, lives in process memory, is anchored
to the block timestamp the publication was prepared at, and advances only on a replacement that was
applied — or logged, in read-only mode — so a failed replacement retries on the next cycle.
Crossed-and-unclearable is an operator condition rather than a bot condition: the book has left the
configured rate window, so the cross is reported and nothing is acted on.
`guardrail.book-cleared` reports how many rungs the book repriced, separately from the own
bootstrap-buy clearance on `guardrail.cross-book-cleared`.

`maturityPremium` makes the effective center a function of that market's remaining time to
maturity, so one bot can quote every configured maturity from one term structure: further maturity
= higher center. The initial `linear` shape resolves
`floor(premiumPerYearBps × secondsToMaturity / 31,536,000)` from the fresh on-chain maturity and
latest Base block timestamp at every cycle, optionally capped by the inclusive `maximumPremiumBps`;
a market at or past maturity contributes zero. The resolved term is added on top of the signed
static `quotePremiumBps`, and the premium decays as maturity approaches; `movementToleranceBps`
absorbs that slow decay exactly like reference movement, so a retained center rests until the
decayed effective center escapes the inclusive deadband. Additional function shapes may be added
later; `shape` selects the active one. Both target-rate strategies compose with it — a `hardcoded`
reference with a maturity premium still decays along the curve, and its load-time shape check only
rejects a shape that no attainable premium can place fully inside the hard bounds (a transiently clamped
rung is documented runtime behavior). Omit the object entirely to keep today's static-center
behavior.

“Lower” and “higher” describe rates, not protocol `buy`/`sell` flags. Because Midnight price is
inverse to rate, lower-rate rungs are encoded as borrow-side `sell` offers and higher-rate rungs as
lend-side `buy` offers. Every bot-created lower-rate offer has `reduceOnly: true`, so a fill may
unwind the maker's existing credit but cannot increase maker debt. Explorers may still label that
offer simply as “borrow”; use the tick-derived APR rather than the side label as the rate.

Rung weight `k` is `10000 + k * sizeSkewBps`, and every weight must stay positive. Positive skew
weights outer rungs more heavily; negative skew weights inner rungs more heavily. Each configured
`lowerRateBudgetAssets` / `higherRateBudgetAssets` is first capped by its fresh side capacity. The
target-market and strategy-total exposure capacities additionally cap only higher-rate lend buys;
lower-rate reduce-only borrow sells are capped by accrued credit and do not consume new lend
exposure. A side below `minimumOfferAssets` emits no offer. Otherwise the allocator funds as many
rungs as can each satisfy the floor, always selecting the closest-to-market rates first, reserves the
floor for each, distributes remaining assets by weight, and assigns integer remainder to the
outermost funded rung. Hard-rate bounds apply to every nonzero rung that can be published; an
exhausted side cannot trigger a bound failure. `targetMarketExposureAssets` must not exceed
`maximumTotalExposureAssets`.

The ladder is state reconciliation, not a collection of independently refilled orders. Every
one-shot `ladder` invocation and every non-overlapping `ladder --monitor` cycle:

1. Reads fresh market credit, wallet balance, allowance, market and strategy exposure, active owned
   groups, group consumption, and the configured target rate (including Blue history only for
   `variable_rate_avg`, and the market's fresh time to maturity only when a maturity premium is
   configured).
2. Reconstructs the remaining active quote. A partially consumed group contributes only its
   remaining assets, and a fully consumed indexed group contributes no rung. A persisted group that
   has not appeared in the eventually consistent API remains pending-active so the bot cannot
   publish an unsafe duplicate while indexing catches up.
3. Generates a complete desired quote from the current capacities and configuration. If the center
   remains inside `movementToleranceBps`, the active center is retained while sizes are still
   recalculated from fresh inventory.
4. Compares the complete active and desired quotes, then selects one decision:

| Decision       | Condition                                                                                                                                                                             | Mutation                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `rest`         | Active and desired quotes are exactly equal, or neither an active nor a fundable desired quote exists.                                                                                | Submits no transaction.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `resize`       | An active ladder exists, its center remains inside tolerance, but fresh sizes, funded rung count, side availability, or grouping have changed.                                        | Replaces the complete market ladder and reports `action: "replace", reason: "resize"`.                                                                                                    |
| `recenter`     | The absolute movement from the active center to the fresh effective center (reference plus quote and maturity premiums) is strictly greater than `movementToleranceBps`.              | Recalculates rates and sizes, replaces the complete ladder, and reports `action: "replace", reason: "recenter"`.                                                                          |
| `book-crossed` | An active ladder exists, its quote is otherwise unchanged, and a third party crosses one side of it inside the configured rate window, past that side's `bookCrossedCooldownSeconds`. | Rechecks the crossing under the mutation lock, then replaces the complete ladder and reports `action: "replace", reason: "book-crossed"`; a cross that has gone reports `action: "rest"`. |

`movementToleranceBps` controls only rate movement. It never suppresses a capacity-driven `resize`.
For example, a retained center can stay at 4.22% while a fill changes five higher-side rungs from
200 USDC each to 160 USDC each.

A replacement is market-wide rather than rung-local. The bot prepares and validates the future tree,
durably reserves its group IDs, confirms cancellation of every remaining active group for the
market, publishes the complete replacement tree, waits for its receipt, and confirms its durable
ownership. Every publication uses the fresh block timestamp, producing new content-addressed group
IDs instead of reusing consumed IDs. This means an unchanged rung also receives a new group ID when
another rung causes a resize or recenter.

Monitoring is interval-based rather than fill-event-driven. With `loopIntervalSeconds: "60"`, a
consumption is normally reconciled by the next cycle after the current cycle and interval finish;
provider reads and receipt confirmation add to that wall-clock time. A direct one-shot `ladder`
command performs the same reconciliation once.

#### Shared-rung consumption and inventory movement

`shared-rung` creates an independent consumption cap and group ID for every funded rung. A fill
reduces only that group's remaining amount on-chain, but the next cycle recalculates the complete
ladder. Partial consumption normally triggers `resize` too: if one 200 USDC rung has 150 USDC left
while fresh side capacity calls for five 190 USDC rungs, the active and desired quotes differ.

Consider 2,000 USDC split initially into 1,000 USDC of market credit and 1,000 USDC of wallet cash,
with five equal rungs per side and these inventory-responsive limits:

```json
{
  "lowerRateBudgetAssets": "2000000000",
  "higherRateBudgetAssets": "2000000000",
  "targetMarketExposureAssets": "2000000000",
  "maximumTotalExposureAssets": "2000000000"
}
```

The initial quote can allocate 200 USDC to each of five lower and five higher rungs. If a 200 USDC
higher-rate lend offer is consumed, approximately 200 USDC moves from wallet cash into market
credit. The next desired quote becomes:

```text
before fill: lower 1,000 = 5 × 200; higher 1,000 = 5 × 200
after fill:  lower 1,200 = 5 × 240; higher   800 = 5 × 160
decision:    replace / resize
```

If both configured side budgets were instead 1,000 USDC, the lower side would remain capped at
1,000 USDC despite the increased credit, while the higher side would shrink to 800 USDC:

```text
after fill: lower 1,000 = 5 × 200; higher 800 = 5 × 160
```

A lower-side reduce-only fill moves inventory in the opposite direction: market credit falls and
wallet cash rises, so the lower side can shrink while the higher side grows, subject to its budget,
allowance, target-market exposure, and total-exposure caps.

`rungCount` is a maximum, not a guaranteed count. With five configured rungs, zero skew, and a 101
USDC minimum, decreasing capacity produces approximately:

| Fresh side capacity | Funded rungs | Equal allocation                            |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1,000 USDC          | 5            | 200 USDC each                               |
| 800 USDC            | 5            | 160 USDC each                               |
| 500 USDC            | 4            | 125 USDC each                               |
| 400 USDC            | 3            | About 133 USDC each, plus integer remainder |
| 100 USDC            | 0            | Side omitted because it is below the floor  |

The closest-to-market rungs are funded first when capacity cannot support the full count.

#### Per-book consumption

`per-book` creates one shared consumption group for every funded lower-side offer and a separate
shared group for every funded higher-side offer. It never creates one group spanning both sides.
All offers on one side can consume the same side-total cap, so a fill at any one rate reduces the
capacity available through every rate in that group.

For three higher-side rates sharing 300 USDC:

```text
4.47% ─┐
4.57%  ├─ higher group H: 300 USDC total
4.67% ─┘
```

If 120 USDC executes at 4.47%, only 180 USDC remains collectively across all three offers. Because
otherwise identical rational takers prefer the best rate and that offer can consume the complete
shared cap, the worse same-side rates generally have no execution incentive. `per-book` is therefore
a set of alternative prices under one side limit, not strict price-level depth. Use `shared-rung`
when each rate must reserve a distinct amount and execution should move through successive levels.

Safety failures are separate from the four normal decisions. Configuration, reference, or decision
failure requests a strategy-wide hard halt; a market-state read failure requests market-local
invalidation. A failed or halted monitored cycle stops the loop and still attempts exhaustive owned
group cleanup. `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` let the in-flight cycle finish and then cancel every remaining
active owned ladder group before the monitor reports `status: "stopped"`.

`LADDER_MARKETS` is exact JSON with the same fields. Every integer-valued property — including the
nested `maturityPremium` integers — must be a quoted decimal string; JSON number tokens, floats,
exponents, malformed values, unknown fields, duplicate markets, and markets outside `MARKET_IDS`
are rejected, and `maturityPremium.shape` remains the JSON string `"linear"`. The variable replaces
the YAML list before semantic validation, so a valid environment list can replace semantically
invalid YAML while YAML parser hazards still fail closed.

### Secrets and failure behavior

Do not commit real configuration. The repository ignores `quoter-bot.yaml` and
`quoter-bot.yml` while keeping the example trackable. Prefer environment variables for the maker
private key and future credentials. If a local YAML file contains a secret, restrict access (for
example `chmod 600 quoter-bot.yaml`).

Configuration errors contain stable field/reason metadata but never rejected values, URLs, private
keys, parser snippets, or nested third-party errors. Explicit file failures are loud but do not echo
the supplied path. Runtime setup reports identify providers by stable IDs only.

## Parameter playground

The stateless local playground exposes exactly the ordered `BOOTSTRAP_MARKETS` and `LADDER_MARKETS`
collections. It renders accessible bootstrap and ladder graphics from deterministic per-market derived
rates, validates them with the same browser-safe pure parsers used by runtime configuration, and never
imports secret, provider, logging, or observability modules. It does not read current offers, balances,
positions, or a live market book; use storage, cookies, a backend, or network requests; or model runtime
capacity.

The URL fragment is a strict, bounded, versioned JSON payload containing only `version`, `bootstrap`,
and `ladder`. Valid edits synchronize with `history.replaceState`; invalid edits leave the last valid
URL untouched. The copied URL reproduces collection order, configuration, and graphics on a fresh page,
including under the GitHub Pages subpath.

Import is paste-only. It accepts a strict bootstrap object/array, ladder object/array, documented
`{"bootstrap": [...], "ladder": [...]}` envelope, or one JSON-string layer containing an unambiguous
supported shape. Unknown or duplicate keys, mixed arrays, malformed/oversized input, and invalid
collections are rejected atomically. The four outputs are Bootstrap JSON, the compact exact
`BOOTSTRAP_MARKETS` value, Ladder JSON, and the compact exact `LADDER_MARKETS` value; each collection
validates independently.

From the repository root, one command runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (also on already-installed
workspaces, where it is fast), creates a fresh isolated build, and serves it on loopback. It does not
run test assertions or require Chromium:

```sh
pnpm run quoter-bot:playground
```

Open the exact URL printed by the command (default `http://127.0.0.1:4173`). Override the listener
with `PORT=5173`, `HOST=localhost`, `--port 5173`, or `--host ::1`; command-line flags take precedence
over environment variables. Only `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1` are accepted. IPv6 may be entered
as `::1` or `[::1]`; the printed URL uses brackets. If the selected port is occupied, the launcher
exits with an actionable error instead of claiming success.

The interactive launcher owns install and build process trees portably: Linux and macOS use detached
process groups, while Windows uses non-shell task-tree termination. Press Ctrl-C to stop; `SIGINT` and
`SIGTERM` perform bounded server shutdown, terminate owned process trees, and remove the temporary
fresh build. Cleanup failures are reported and produce a nonzero exit.

 * allocator role, run the strategy, simulate the exact broadcast bytes, and submit (or dry-run-log)
 * on sim-ok. A failure in one vault logs `vault.error` and never blocks the others; counters are
 * folded after every vault settles and closed by one wide `tick.end` line.
 *
 * The read is batched, so unlike the per-vault work it is a single point of failure: a rejected
 * request costs every vault this pass rather than one, and the interval gate means the retry is the
 * next reallocation interval rather than the next block. That is the trade for N-1 fewer round trips
 * and N-1 fewer deployless deploys; the failure is fanned out below so the counters and `vault.error`
 * lines still read per vault.

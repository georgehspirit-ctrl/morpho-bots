/**
 * The Blue-shaped adapter over `@repo/swaps`' {@link composeMultiVenueQuoting}: keeps the
 * `(plan, out)` signature the tick consumes and projects the lens output into the package's plain
 * `QuoteRequest` — Blue markets have a single collateral, `out.params.collateralToken`. The package
 * resolves the pre-swap unwrap chain, then starts — without awaiting — the venue probe for the
 * POST-unwrap `(collateral, loan)` pair, gated to this liquidatable pair and staleMs-cached so no
 * venue calls hit quiet markets. Venues are ranked against whatever the cache already holds, and
 * only the chosen one is firm-quoted. An operator-excluded collateral short-circuits to `no_config` (no API call), preserving
 * no-API-call semantics for a position the bot won't route.
